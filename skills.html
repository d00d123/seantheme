              <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-console"></span> Writing Code</h4>
              <p>I can write html in order to format information and layout webpages (I built this site, with the help of bootstrap). I can also use CSS and am currently learning to use webkit functionality. I'm also devleoping my jQuery skills - visit the <a href="projects.html">work samples</a> page to see a script I wrote in action.</p>

              <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span> Strategic Communications</h4>
              <p>During my time in communications at the Peel District School Board, I've been through crisis communications, labour communications, the launch of a <a href="intranet-project.html">new intranet</a> site and the launch of a controversial update to the Ontario curriculum. All that to say - I've learned how to think strategically and target diverse audiences.</p>

              <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span> User Experience Design</h4>
              <p>One of my main duties as the web communications assistant at the Peel District School Board is to guide the board when it comes to creating new content. With more than 20,000 full-time staff, every piece of content has to be written and organized strategically to ensure it's accessible.</p>

              <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-th-list"></span> Web Content Creation</h4>
              <p>Sometimes the departments I work with ask for me to help create the content as well as organize it. I've had many opportunities to hone my skills at generating engaging web content. I've become especially adept at looking at a large amount of content, and figuring out how to break it down into chunks.</p>

              <p>I provide intranet-management training to department webmasters within the board, to make sure they know how to manage their sites and to provide support when they run into problems. I also provide content and site management training to school staff who update their school's external website.</p>

              <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-comment"></span> Technical Support</h4>
              <p>Technical support can try your patience and expose you to some very frustrated people, but it's also critical when it comes to offering any sort of technical solution. I've learned that if you stick it out through the tough parts, the big smils on a user's face when they understand the topic makes all the struggle worth it. Gotta get those smiles!</p>

              <p>Retirement dinners, parent conferences, school council events and special ceremonies. I've helped with logistical support and even been an event lead on a few, key Peel board events. This was a weak point for me when I started, so I asked for as many as I could take to help build up my skills. Let's get logistical.</p>

              <p>I'm always looking for new skills to learn, or for an opportunity to strengthen my exisitng ones. Any projects I'm given will be approached from a perspective of professional growth. I always ask myself "What can I learn from this so I can be even better next time?"</p>
