    <div class="col-md-8"><h3>My name is Matt.</h3>
    <p>The first thing to know about me is that I am a people person. I've got more than eight years of experience in retail (customer service, technical support, technical training) and I've worked in the digital communciations realm at the Peel District School Board for two years before I started at the City of Mississauga in July 2016.</p>
    <p>As I've worked more and more in the digital communications field, I've come to realize that I love working on user experience. User experience is that perfect sweet spot between communications and technology, that I'm always searching for. It's a place that I find my passion really ignites. I'm able to work closely with people and think about how different audiences would approach content, but I also get to dig into the code, finding problems - and solutions.</p>
    <div class="col-md-2"></div>
    <div class="col-md-10"><blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">User experience is that perfect sweet spot between communications and technology, that I'm always searching for. </blockquote></div>
    <p>I also think I'm drawn to user experience because of how deeply connected you become with the content of a website. You have to be in touch with so many different asepcts of web content: writing, development, user testing and strategy. All of these connect to create an enriching website. When you are helping develop the user experience for a site, you do all of these things and by the end, you know the content better than most people on the web team.</p>
    <p>If I had to identify an environment where I thrive most, it would be one that keeps me on my toes. I often volunteer for projects that involve skills I want to build so I can dive right in and start learning. When I wanted to learn Bootstrap, I built a site (this one, in fact). When I wanted to learn jQuery, I wrote a to do list. I learn best when I'm applying the knowledge to my work, and I love to be challenged.</p>

    <div class="col-md-10"><blockquote>If I had to identify an environment where I thrive most, it would be one that keeps me on my toes.</blockquote></div>
    <div class="col-md-2"></div>
    </div>
    <p>That's enough about me professionally. What do I do in my spare time? I love space (seriously, just get me started talking about anything space related), photography (most of the images on this site are taken by me) and puttering around in my vegetable garden (inspiration for lots of my photography). When I'm not doing any of this, I'm probably playing a video game or cooking in my kitchen.</p>
