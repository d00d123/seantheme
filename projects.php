            <h3>City of Mississauga Digital Strategy</h3>
            <p>The City is building a new website and they're developing a whole new digital strategy to match it. Streamlined governance, consistent content and evidence-based design are just a few of the revoltionary things going into this strategy. I'm helping with writing content and developing content strategy. I'm also helping out with some project communications and pitching in with user testing and anything else I can help with. This is an excellent project to learn the ins and outs of developing a modern website.</p>

            <h3>Intranet Redesign</h3>
            <p>This was the main project I worked on with the Peel board. I started it as an intern and launched it in January 2016. It involved working with all the departments in the board and we moved over hundreds of pages of content. The project has won an IABC Ovation Award of Merit.</p>

            <h3>Intranet Training Sessions</h3>
            <p>Eight months before launch it was time to train all of my department webmasters. I ran training sessions weekly throughout July of 2015 and covered basic page editing, how to use the style guide and how to approach file hierarchy. Sessions were two hours plus time for questions. I also encouraged users to attend multiple sessions until they felt comfortable.</p>
            <p>I continue to support and provide training to any staff that require it. Most recently I ran a tips and tricks session during a professional development day to help office staff learn how to use the intranet and leverage all of its features.</p>

            <p>I always try to be available to my users to provide support whenever they need it. Regardless of whether a manual is available, I understand that a detailed, personal explanation can help many users feel more comfortable. However, for times when I'm unavailable, it's important there are detailed training manuals in plain language. I make sure to approach each manual as if it's my first time using the product. No detail is too small to mention.</p>

            <h3>Pupil Accommodation Review Webpage</h3>
            <p>A review is currently underway to examine a proposal to close Gordon Graydon Memorial School. This <a href="http://www.peelschools.org/aboutus/accommodationreview/par/Pages/default.aspx">Pupil Accommodation Review (PAR)</a> is a critical communications piece and the webpage for it on <a href="http://www.peelschools.org">the main board website</a> is the primary communications method for PAR information. The information is dense and complicated. Working on the page was a great opportunity to work on my user experience skills as well as work on my ability to collaborate with groups that have different communications goals and priorities.</p>

            <h3>Remembrance Day Ceremony</h3>
            <p>I was asked to support on the Central Board Office's Remembrance Day ceremony in 2014 and asked to lead the event for 2015. This was a great chance for me build my event skills and strengthen my organization. I also appreciated the chance to source student performances from Peel board schools as it gave me a chance to connect with school staff.</p>

            <h3>Short Link</h3>
            <p>In my first year with the board I got the idea to buy a low cost domain and brand all of our shortlinks on social media using bit.ly. We purchased pdsb.me and then got the shortlink setup six months later (the delay was due to labour disruptions). Now news releases and other communications items are linked with a pdsb.me link on our social media!</p>

            <h3>Special Education Plan</h3>
            <p>The old Special Education Plan page is still in use because this is a project in progress. I'm helping to refine and simplify the way the Special Education Plan is presented. Working with the Superintendent of Special Education, I've used text formatting and some CSS to make headings clearer in the plan.</p>
            <p>The page is still huge with a lot of text but as the project moves forward, images and other graphics will be added to help break up content. Notice how when you jump to a section it is highlighted briefly, to bring the user's attention to their target. Remember: this page is in beta.</p>

            <h3>Student Volunteer Page</h3>
            <p>This was a little side project I worked on with my contact in our IT department at Peel. The older volunteer board was just a big huge table with the organization name and a PDF that they would submit. There was no expiry tracking and no extra information.</p>
            <p>I developed a layout that included collapsable items, position summaries, and expiry dates on the back end so that old postings disappear when they are no longer valid. A subscription option is being worked on now so that students can get weekly emails with all the postings.</p>

            <h3>Style Guide for the Peel board Intranet</h3>
            <p>Half the battle of making a good user experience is implementing consistent style. I realized early on in the intranet project that I wouldn't be able to enforce consistent style unless I made it easy to follow. I made the style guide so that all staff could access it whenever they needed it.</p>
