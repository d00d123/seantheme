<div class="page-header"><h4>One of the hardest parts of the intranet redesign project was that no single person had ever pushed for consistency across the board when it came to formatting. As a result, some pages used Arial, some pages used Comic Sans, some pages used 10 different fonts all in different colours. There were many AODA violations and the pages were generally not accessible for those with impairments (especially visual impairments because of some of the colour schemes chosen).<br/><br/>That's why one of biggiest projects was developing the style guide. Using this, I was able to make it easy for departments to use consistent style across the board. After that, the majority of departments were more than happy to follow the style guide. I've reproduced the style guide below. This is available on the Peel board intranet for all staff to see.</h4></div>

<h2>About this guide</h2>
<p>This is the style guide for the Peel District School Board intranet site (internal website for employee information). The link (URL) for the intranet is 
   http://intranet.peelschools.org. </p>
<p>This guide will help you create and style content for your department web pages. You will find information on many topics, including how to use the board logo and where to get logo files, how to name your forms, what fonts and formatting to use on your webpage, and much more. </p>
<p>This guide is intended as a resource for all site administrators and will be maintained by Communications &amp; Community Relations Support Services. The guide is available digitally as a webpage on the intranet and as a downloadable PDF. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>How to use the Peel board intranet</h2>
<p>The Peel board intranet site is meant as an online resource for all board staff. Whether you are looking for a form, trying to find the best contact in a department or you just want to learn more about board initiatives, the intranet is your one-stop shop for updated information.</p>
<p>From the main page—your MySite page—you can access your own personalized quick links, email, SkyDrive, forms, policies and operating procedures, departments, services, who&#39;s who?, personalized calendar and site help, as well as view board news and updates on initiatives.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>For information on accessibility standards as required by the 
   <em>Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA), 2005,</em> visit the 
   <a href="/hr/abilities/accessibility/Pages/default.aspx">accessibility page</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Text</h2>
<h3>Fonts</h3>
<p>To maintain AODA accessibility standards, the Peel board&#39;s standard font is Arial. All board materials (digital and printed) are in the process of transitioning to Arial, with the exception of the board&#39;s official logo.</p>
<p>While site administrators have the ability to change the font, we ask them to use the default font, i.e. Arial. Not only is Arial a sans-serif font that is easy-to-read and it is available on every device (Apple, Microsoft, Android, etc.). The standard font size is 12 pt for body text. These settings have been made the default for the intranet site so that administrators don&#39;t have to change anything to maintain board style.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>Formatting</h3>
<p>Formatting is key when you are trying to keep your materials consistent. To help make it easier for you to stay consistent with other board materials and other intranet web pages, we have preloaded styles for headings and text into the intranet editing window. When you add text to a web page, which is explained later in ths guide, &#160;keep the following tips in mind: </p>
<p> 
   <strong>Always use the pre-made heading and body text styles available in the editing toolbar of the intranet when you are inserting content. These are pre-set in accordance with the standards outlined in this document.</strong> </p>
   

<h1>Heading 1</h1>   
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<p>Body text</p>
<p><strong>Important text</strong></p>
<p><em>Contextual notes</em></p>
<p><a href="http://reddit.com">Links</a></p>

<br/>

<p>These styles were developed to maintain consistency, make your text look great and help users easily read and navigate the intranet. We all use the internet and get used to certain things (links are often underlined and blue, home is on the top left, etc.). Using a website that steers away from these rules, is confusing to users and makes it harder to use the site. That&#39;s why these formatting rules are similar to many of the websites you are already familiar with. </p>
<p>When you want to emphasize content, e.g. an important point or due date, 
   <strong>never underline</strong> the text for emphasis. We are all used to underlined text being a hyperlink. Instead, use 
   <strong>bolded text</strong> to show emphasis. </p>
<p>Remember, though, don&#39;t bold too much or it loses its effect. 
   <strong>When everything is bold the user starts to think that nothing is important and you lose an excellent way to show how important some information is. </strong>Italics are helpful for side notes that aren&#39;t part of your content but are related to it, like noting the date an important page was updated. (e.g. 
   <em>Last edited June 4, 2015</em>)</p>
<p> 
   <strong>Always</strong> follow the style guide. It may not seem important, but when your content is different from the rest of the board, it makes your page seem unprofessional and confuses your reader. </p>
<p> 
    <strong>Don&#39;t highlight</strong> text in a page (<span style="background-color:yellow;">like this</span>). Highlighting text makes it harder for people with visual impairments to read the text.</p>
<p> 
   <em>Preferred:</em></p>
<p>Applications will be accepted 
   <strong>no later than June 20, 2015.</strong></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p> 
   <em>Less effective:</em></p>
<p>Applications will be accepted no later than June 20, 2015.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>Writing for the web</h3>
<p>Writing for the web is different than writing a printed report. Web writing is concise, and helps readers find useful information quickly—often within seconds. Here are a few quick tips to help you write for the web:</p>
<p>Adopt a practice called &quot;embedded links&quot; when you link to a page. Embedded links are links that you place in your 
   <a href="https://google.com/">sentence content</a> (that&#39;s an example) so that the user isn&#39;t interrupted. Many people try inserting links by directing users to them. Here is an example of the right and wrong way to put links in your content:</p>
<p> 
   <em>Preferred: </em></p>
<p>Check out our 
   <a href="http://www.greatsite.com/newsletter">newsletter</a>. We update it monthly so you are always in the know!</p>
<p> 
   <em>Less effective:</em></p>
<p>We release our newsletter once a month! Click here to read our newsletter: 
   <a href="http://www.google.com/newsletter">www.google.com/newsletter</a>. </p>
<p>Make sure to embed links to other relevant content whenever you can. When everything is connected, users are more likely to read your content and have a better understanding of what you are telling them. </p>
<p>The exception to the embedded link rule is if you are listing resources. Then you can just hyperlink names, like this:</p>
<h4>Some useful sites:</h4>

<h2>Visuals</h2>
<h3>Choosing good images</h3>
<p>When you choose images to insert into a web page, there are a few things to keep in mind. The first rule of thumb is 
   <strong>avoid clipart</strong>. Clipart makes most web pages seem less professional and generally doesn&#39;t add much to the page. </p>
<p>People like seeing photos on web pages, so we have put together a variety of photos that are sized perfectly for your web page. Feel free to check out our 
   <a href="/comm/comm/styleguide/Pages/Photo-Library.aspx">photo library</a>. If you want to use your own photos, make sure they are large enough for the page or else they will become pixelated (when images look like many tiny squares). The page width is 765 pixels (px), so size/trim your images to this width. If you need help, email 
   <a href="mailto:webmaster@peelsb.com">webmaster@peelsb.com</a>. </p>
<p>Here is an example of a good image vs. a bad image.</p>
<p> 
   <em>Preferred: (high resolution, good quality, photo instead of clipart)</em></p>
<p> 
   <em>
      <img src="images/applegood.jpg" alt="" width="600px"/></em>&#160;</p>
<p> 
   <em>Less effective: (clipart, doesn't add to the content)</em></p>
<p> 
   <img src="images/appleclipart.jpg" alt="" width="200"/>&#160;</p><br/>
<p> 
   <em>Least effective: (pixelated)</em></p>
<p>&#160;<img src="images/applesmall.jpg" alt="" width="300px"/></p>
<h3>Image sizes</h3>
<p>Here are common dimensions for images on the Peel board intranet:</p>
<p> 
   <strong>Spotlight banner</strong>: 927 px wide, 224 px tall</p>
<p>This document will be updated as additional standard image sizes become available. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>Official logo files</h3>
<p>You can find the Peel board&#39;s official logo files in a variety of formats on our 
   <a href="http://google.com/">graphic standards page</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>Using videos</h3>
<p>The best practice for inserting video in your web page is to use YouTube. YouTube is a dedicated video hosting service and also provides the ability for site administrators to embed videos in web pages. To embed videos, follow these simple steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
   <li>Upload your video to 
      <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">www.youtube.com</a>. YouTube provides support in their own help section to walk you through uploading a video. If your video is only suitable for internal audiences, make sure you upload it as &quot;Unlisted&quot; as opposed to &quot;Public&quot; or &quot;Private.&quot;</li>
   <li>Once the video has been uploaded, go to the video page in YouTube and click the &quot;Share&quot; button below the video.</li>
   <li>Choose &quot;embed video&quot; and copy the text that you see.</li>
   <li>Go to your intranet page and click edit, then click on the spot you want your video to be. </li>
   <li>Up in the formatting toolbar click &quot;Embed code&quot; and paste the text from YouTube into the window that pops up.</li>
   <li>Finally, click &quot;Okay&quot; and the video will be embedded. </li>
</ol>
<h2>&#160;</h2> 
<h2 id="filenames">Files</h2>
<h3>File names</h3>
<p>Keep the names of your files consistent and legible. To maintain consistency across the board, please follow this format for file names:</p>
<p> 
   <em>File Name – Current Date.pdf</em></p>
<p> 
   <em>*Date format: June 12 2015, Dec 25 2012, etc. </em></p>
<p>If the date isn&#39;t necessary, you don&#39;t need to include it. If the date is part of the file name (see School Year Calendar example below) then you can include it in the title. </p>
<p> 
   <em>Examples:</em></p>
<p> 
   <em>Advisory Committee Meeting Minutes – May 12 2015.docx</em></p>
<p> 
   <em>Intranet Style Guide.pdf</em></p>
<p> 
   <em>School Year Calendar 2014-15.pdf</em></p>
<p>Don&#39;t include version numbers or FINAL, etc. We understand that many people work in versions, however, you should never be sharing anything other than the final/current version of a document on the intranet. Any document shared on your site is available to all staff, board-wide. Once you are done working through draft versions with your team, you can post the final version to your intranet page and name it according to guidelines presented above. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>File types</h3>
<p>Please make sure you use file types that are usable by the majority of board members. For documents, the standard is 
   <strong>.docx (Word document)</strong>, for spreadsheets 
   <strong>.xlsx (Excel document)</strong>, for presentations 
   <strong>.pptx (PowerPoint document)</strong>. These are all the default file types created by the Microsoft Office applications on your Peel board computer. Make sure you use the default settings to ensure that the most recent file type is used, ensuring compatibility with other board computers.</p>
<table class="styletable" cellspacing="0">
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td class="styletable" style="width: 50%;"> 
            <strong>File</strong></td>
         <td class="styletable" style="width: 50%;"> 
            <strong>File Type</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td class="styletable">Documents</td>
         <td class="styletable">Microsoft Word 
            <strong>(.docx)</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td class="styletable">Spreadsheets</td>
         <td class="styletable">Microsoft Excel 
            <strong>(.xlsx)</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td class="styletable">Presentations</td>
         <td class="styletable">Microsoft PowerPoint 
            <strong>(.pptx)</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td class="styletable">Images</td>
         <td class="styletable">JPEG or PNG or GIF 
            <strong>(.jpeg, .jpg, .png, .gif)</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td class="styletable">Forms</td>
         <td class="styletable">Microsoft Word or PDF 
            <strong>(.docx, .pdf)</strong></td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For any files that you don&#39;t want others to edit, remember to save the document in 
   <strong>.pdf</strong> format. Microsoft Word is able to export files as 
   <strong>.pdf</strong> files, and you can see this functionality directly in the &quot;File&quot; menu. Another great thing about PDF files is that they save the formatting so you can be sure that what you see is what everyone else sees.</p>
<p>When creating department forms you have a few options. You can save them as Word documents or fillable PDFs (if you know how to create these). You can also contact Learning Technology Support Services via Heat Web if you want to work with them to create a web form that will email results to someone in your department. When naming forms, follow the same file-naming conventions that were outlined in the section above. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>Where to upload files</h3>
<p>The intranet is set up to ensure that you only have to upload a file in one place whenever you add something to your site. This will help move away from the problem you run into when files are updated in some spots and not others. </p>
<p>Upload all of your documents to the page that they apply to. For instance, the PDF version of this guide will be uploaded to the &quot;Style Guide&quot; page. Whenever I update this guide I&#39;ll upload the new version to the same place and replace the old version of the document.</p>
<p>When you are uploading a form, you will upload this to the &quot;Forms&quot; section of your site. Handle new versions the same way you would documents (as described above).</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to always replace the old version of a file when you upload the new version. When people visit your page you want them to be able to easily find the most recent version of any document. Leaving old versions up can also end up with people filling out the wrong forms, leading to confusion and wasted time. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Site administrators</h2>
<p>Every department page has site administrators who are responsible for maintaining all the information on their department web pages. These are the only people who will have the ability to edit the department site. If you want a change to be made on your department&#39;s page, please contact your department&#39;s website administrator to have these changes made. </p>
