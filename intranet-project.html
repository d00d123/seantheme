<h3>Project Introduction</h3>
 <p>When the project started, the existing intranet existed on two platforms: a site created and managed in Macromedia Contribute that was over 10 years old with more than 100 pages of mostly outdated content and a Microsoft SharePoint site implemented in 2009 with thousands of user profiles. The SharePoint site acted as a portal, linking users to board applications and their email, while the Macromedia site housed all department content and board documents such as forms, resources and organizational charts.</p>
 <div class="col-md-5">
     <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">The SharePoint and Macromedia sites were each managed by a separate team in the board’s LTSS department (IT), and the Communications department was not involved in managing the intranet at all.</blockquote>
 </div>
<p>The SharePoint and Macromedia sites were each managed by a separate team in the board’s LTSS department (IT), and the Communications department was not involved in managing the intranet at all. As a result of this structure, content was disorganized and out-of-date—processes were not in place to manage content. There was no clear style or content standard, and department webmasters didn’t have a dedicated person to support them when creating and organizing content. 
Focus groups and a board-wide survey conducted by Communications in fall 2013 identified many user problems with the existing intranet, including the lack of a functional search and confusing site layouts. The project was approved by the board senior leadership team with the goal of creating a new system that addressed user concerns and introduced new features to support stronger communication throughout the board.</p>
  
<h3>Audience</h3>
 <div class="col-md-4" style="float:right;">
     <div class="thumbnail"><a href="images/INET-home.PNG" target="_blank">
             <img src="images/INET-home.PNG" alt=""/>
             <div class="caption">Macromedia Site Homepage</div>
         </a></div>
 </div>
 <p>As with any intranet, the primary audience for this project is internal board staff. The staff members within a school board are an extremely varied audience with many different roles, abilities, ranging broadly in demographics. The Peel board employs more than 16,000 full-time staff and 4,000 contract staff amongst nine different union and non-union employee groups. As in any organization, staff can be resistant to change whether it is due to them being less comfortable with technology or used to their current routine. Depending on their role in the board, an employee may access completely different resources on a daily basis to support their role.</p>

 <p>When considering user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) decisions, it was important to think about training and adoption for users who are not technologically savvy and don’t often read training documents. At the same time, it was important to create a modern interface that would serve current and future board staff in a sustainable manner.</p>
 
 <p>Another UI/UX concern was customizability. While the redesign team was using an overall goal of simplicity when designing the new site, every staff group had different needs; it would be impossible to present them all on the same page while also maintaining a clean, and user-friendly interface. It became clear early in the project that a certain degree of customizability would be a key factor in the success of the site.</p>

 <h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>
 <h4>Goal</h4>
 <p>Create a simple and intuitive, up-to-date intranet that provides every staff member with the information they need to support student success. 
</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>All major functions will be accessible within three clicks from the landing page.</li>
        <li>Staff will be able to complete 90 per cent of department content changes and updates without intervention from LTSS or Communications staff.</li>
        <li>Content structure and reinforcement of training will ensure that content is far easier to keep updated, helping to avoid incorrect or out-of-date information.</li>
        <li>Staff can use search to find what they are looking for 90% of the time.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
 
<h3>Solution Overview</h3>
<p>The new intranet was developed with features to address the feedback received during research as well as the overarching project goals. Improvements over the old intranet sites were not only in the design of the actual site, but also in the addition of Communications staff to the intranet site management team. With LTSS handling technical solutions and Communications managing content, both teams were able to contribute to decisions that rely on their areas of expertise.</p>

 <div class="col-md-4" style="float:right;">
     <div class="thumbnail"><a href="images/NEW-ops.PNG" target="_blank">
             <img src="images/NEW-ops.PNG" alt=""/>
             <div class="caption">New Policies and Operating Procedures Page</div>
         </a></div>
 </div>

<p>Along with managing content, Communications agreed to directly support and train department webmasters to promote consistency across all departments, resolving the many content issues that plagued the old sites, including outdated content, content duplication and accessibility issues.</p>
<p>Areas that involve both content and technical decisions (UI/UX, new features, etc.) are a shared responsibility by LTSS and Communications, and will be discussed and decided upon as a team moving forward to ensure all changes are best for the system and fit well within existing technical frameworks.</p>
<p>The design of the new intranet was developed to specifically address the concerns discovered during the research. Staff identified that they wanted easy access to board and school news as well as an easy way to navigate to their most use links and applications. Staff also agreed that some level of customization for their home page would be helpful, and that it should be specific to a user’s employee group.</p>

<p>On the new home page there is a spotlight area to highlight current board initiatives, keeping staff updated on time-sensitive items. Below the spotlight section is a grid of buttons that changes depending on the user’s employee group to show applications used frequently by those staff members. Important system news and news from schools are included on the home page to highlight exciting events and activities taking place within the Peel board.</p>

<div class="col-md-4"><blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">Communications agreed to directly support and train department webmasters to promote consistency across all departments, resolving the many content issues that plagued the old sites, including outdated content, content duplication and accessibility issues.</blockquote></div>
<p>The top navigation bar follows staff across the intranet with quick-and-easy access to departments, forms, board policies and operating procedures, staff and school directories, as well as a quick access bar with email, calendar, search, help and quick links. Quick links is one of the key features that aligns with the need identified for customization and the objective of making major functions available within three clicks of the home page. The quick links menu is a customizable menu unifying all important board applications and pages, as well as custom links and documents that staff can add to their personalized quick links page. Staff can edit the list of board links to show or hide items, ensuring their view is exactly what they need—and the applications they access the most.</p>

<p>A new document management system was implemented for forms as well as board policies and operating procedures. These items are now indexed from across all board pages and compiled into a comprehensive list. Finding a form is now easy using a search bar that refines the list as a user types. All forms are also broken down by department and sub-department. By bringing these documents together in one place and making them searchable, not only can staff find something without knowing which department it belongs to, but we have also made it easy to control the version of a form available because it is uploaded and managed only by the department that creates it. It’s also only ever uploaded once, with links directing to it.</p>
<p>Finally, a new search function has been developed to help staff search for content across the intranet in a broad or refined manner. This new function, combined with better document management due to training done by Communications, means that when staff search for something that exists on the new site, they find it. </p>
